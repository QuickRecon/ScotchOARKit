# ScotchOARKit

This is our new code for controlling the Scotch College version of the Open Academic Robot Kit, which will be written from the ground up in Java, rather than a mix of languages such as Python and C++. The code is not licensed as of now but it will be licensed under the GNU LGPL. The old code can be found in the stable branch.
