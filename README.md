# ScotchOARKit - Java Branch{

###Oh, Hello! 
This branch is for our new code, which will be written from thr ground up, in Java, rather than a mix of langauges such as Python and C++. The code is not licensed as of now, but when it it, it will be licensed under the GNU GPL; much to QuickRecon's disagreement.
